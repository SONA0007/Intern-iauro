This repository contains my work as a software intern at iauro. It includes various implementations and projects demonstrating my understanding of frontend technologies, primarily using React.

## Overview
This repository contains my work as a software intern at iauro. It includes various implementations and projects demonstrating my understanding of frontend technologies, primarily using React.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS
- **State Management:** Context API, Redux, Redux Toolkit, Thunk
- **Styling:** Material UI, Custom Themes
- **APIs & Networking:** Axios, Mock APIs
- **Build & Tooling:** Webpack, Babel, ESLint, Prettier
- **Component Development:** Storybook, NX Workspace

## React Concepts Used
- React Router DOM: Implemented for navigation between different views.
- React Hooks: Utilized useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback to manage state and performance optimizations.
- Context API & Redux: Used for state management and handling global application state efficiently.
- Material UI & Custom Themes: Integrated Material UI components and created custom themes for better UI consistency.
- Async API Calls: Used Axios in conjunction with Redux Thunk to handle asynchronous data fetching.
- Component-Based Development: Built reusable components.
- Linting & Code Formatting: Configured ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and consistency.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SONA0007/Intern-iauro.git
