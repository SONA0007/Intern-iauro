# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Certainly! Below is a detailed `README.md` file for your **Task Management System** frontend repository. It includes an overview of the project, the challenges faced, and how they were resolved. You can add this to your Git repository.

# **Task Management System - Frontend**
## **Overview**
The **Task Management System** is a web application built using modern frontend technologies to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The frontend is developed using **React**, **Redux**, **React Router**, and **Material UI**, with **Vite** as the build tool. The application features a sidebar for navigation, a calendar view for task scheduling, and a profile page for user statistics.

### **Key Features**
- **Task Management**:
  - Add, update, and delete tasks.
  - Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- **Calendar View**:
  - View tasks on a calendar based on their due dates.
- **Profile Page**:
  - Visualize task completion statistics using charts.
- **Dark Mode**:
  - Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Remote Login**:
  - Integrate a login component from a remote app using **Vite Federation**.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - Redux (for state management)
  - React Router (for routing)
  - Material UI (for styling and components)
  - Vite (for faster builds)
  - Vite Federation (for micro-frontend architecture)
- **Charts**:
  - react-chartjs-2 (for task analysis and user statistics)
- **Date Handling**:
  - dayjs (for date manipulation)

## **Challenges Faced and Solutions**

### **1. Multiple Versions of React**
- **Challenge**:
  - The error `"A React Element from an older version of React was rendered"` occurred due to multiple versions of React in the project.
- **Solution**:
  - Used `npm dedupe` to remove duplicate versions of React.
  - Ensured all dependencies used the same version of React.

### **2. Module Federation with Vite**
- **Challenge**:
  - Integrating the `RemoteLogin` component from a remote app using Vite Federation resulted in a **404 error** and **CORS issues**.
- **Solution**:
  - Verified the remote app was running and serving the `remoteEntry.js` file.
  - Configured CORS headers in the remote app’s server.
  - Used `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for dynamic import and error handling.

#### **How `remoteEntry.js` is Imported and Consumed**
- The `remoteEntry.js` file is generated by the **remote app** (`remote-login`) and contains the exposed components (e.g., `Login`).
- In the **host app** (`host-app`), the `remoteEntry.js` file is dynamically imported using **Vite Federation**:
  ```javascript
  // host-app/vite.config.js
  remotes: {
    'remote-login': 'http://localhost:5001/assets/remoteEntry.js',
  },
  ```
- The `Login` component is then lazily loaded in the host app:
  ```javascript
  const RemoteLogin = React.lazy(() => import('remote-login/Login'));
  ```

#### **How CORS and Proxy Helped**
- **CORS**:
  - The remote app configured CORS headers to allow requests from the host app:
    ```javascript
    // remote-login/vite.config.js
    server: {
      cors: {
        origin: 'http://localhost:5000', // Allow requests from the host app
      },
    },
    ```
- **Proxy**:
  - The host app used a proxy to forward requests to the remote app, avoiding CORS issues:
    ```javascript
    // host-app/vite.config.js
    server: {
      proxy: {
        '/assets/remoteEntry.js': {
          target: 'http://localhost:5001', // Forward requests to the remote app
          changeOrigin: true,
        },
      },
    },
    ```

### **3. Uncaught TypeError and 404 Errors**
- **Challenge**:
  - The **404 error** occurred because the `remoteEntry.js` file was not found.
  - The **Uncaught TypeError** occurred because the remote module failed to load.
- **Solution**:
  - Verified the remote app was running and serving the `remoteEntry.js` file.
  - Used `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to handle dynamic imports gracefully:
    ```javascript
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading Login...</div>}>
      <RemoteLogin />
    </Suspense>
    ```
  - Added an **error boundary** to handle failures:
    ```javascript
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading Login...</div>}>
        <RemoteLogin />
      </Suspense>
    </ErrorBoundary>
    ```

### **4. Dark Mode Implementation**
- **Challenge**:
  - Implementing a dark/light theme toggle using Material UI required dynamic theme switching.
- **Solution**:
  - Used Material UI’s `ThemeProvider` and `createTheme` to dynamically switch between light and dark themes.
  - Saved the user’s theme preference in `localStorage` for persistence.

### **5. Task Analysis and User Statistics**
- **Challenge**:
  - Displaying task completion statistics and user activity trends required integrating charts.
- **Solution**:
  - Used `react-chartjs-2` to create bar charts and line charts for task analysis and user statistics.

### **6. Calendar View**
- **Challenge**:
  - Displaying tasks on a calendar based on their due dates required integrating a calendar library.
- **Solution**:
  - Used `@fullcalendar/react` to render tasks on a calendar.
